# Introduction
A study from 2017 discussed and compared the effect of ecomorph on hind limb length in anoles and geckos [@hagey2017there]. Based on this work, we want to analyze the relationship between hind limb length and snout-vent length across different ecomorphs of *Anolis*. By testing for the significance of predictors and correcting for phylogenetic relationships, we can determine whether snout-vent length and ecomorph explain variations in hind limb length and subsequently formulate models that visualize those effects.

# Methods

We examined the ecological parameters the lizard compared to the hindlimb-SVL relationship by first creating a linear model, and then creating a phylogenetic least squares model using a PGLS model [@felsenstein1985phylogenies]. We chose the linear model because it it allowed us to consider the significance of the ecomorph on the hindlimb-SVL relationship, and the phylogenetic least squares model allowed us to determine if any seen patterns occurred as a result of ecomorp or phylogeny.

Plot of the residuals of model BM2 against each ecomorph

# Discussion

An analysis of the two covariates indicated that perch diameter produces a reliable model for predicting hind limb length for an ecomorph of anoles. This finding suggests that there is a strong correlation between perch diameter and hind-limb length. Additionally, perch diameter is the better predictor of hind-limb length, producing a P-value (0.0005) 2 orders of magnitude smaller than perch height. This is indicative of a strong correlation with hind-limb length.


# Author Contributions
Karim established anole.log data tibble and constructed two simple linear models. Philip plotted the residuals against perch diameter and height. Steve made the BM model of trait evolution. Matteo assessed the fit of each of the models using AICc and AICw, and droduced a plot that concisely visualizes the effect of the covariate(s) and factors. Everyone equally contributed to the report.
